I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Electrial Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) advised by Prof. [C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://mcl.usc.edu/people/cckuo/) in Media Communications Lab. Before that, I received my B. Eng. degree from [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Zuren Feng](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/jsnr.jsp?wbtreeid=1632&wbwbxjtuteacherid=464).

My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision, especially generative models for texture synthesis, image generation, super-resolution, etc. I am passionate about applying effective and efficient machine-learning algorithms to practical problems. 

More information is available in my [curriculum vitae](https://xuejingl.github.io/cv/).
